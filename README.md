## Bio
Hello my name is Jessennia Steinberg and I live in Spokane, Washington. Right now I go to EWU where I'm studying design. When I first started out, I always liked creative things and knew that is what I wanted to do. Now, I really enjoy photography,video editing, and drawing. I have always loved the behind the scenes of any creative project, and I would love to be a part of or make my own.
